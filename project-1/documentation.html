        <p class="title has-text-danger-dark">NoteWorthy:</p>
        <p class="has-text-danger mb-4">This website has been designed to take data from the OpenDota API and present it in a usable and digestable manner for new players to get a basic understanding of each hero. 
          The website utalizes Bulma to style the pages and make the information presentable as well as customized web components to make the pages look unique and easy to read. The website
          stores your last search terms within localized storage to provide easy use and extra functionality to the page. It also utalizes Firebase to track how many favorites each hero has.
        </p>


        <p class="title has-text-danger-dark">Grading:</p>
        <p class="has-text-danger mb-4">In this project I utalized fetch and promises to grab data from my API to be presented to the user. I extensivly utalized the Bulma framework
          to styalize my webpages and present the information on the screen to the user in an easy and digestable manner while also keeping a uniform color scheme and style 
          between the pages. I created multiple custom web components that are used across a multitude of the web pages for more variety in styling and design.
           I also utalized Firebase to track how many favorites each hero has and presented that data to the users.
        </p>


        <p class="title has-text-danger-dark">ToDo:</p>
        <p class="has-text-danger mb-4">I would like to add to create five man team of heros that users can save and favorite. This allows users to display as well as search for the most popular/meta teams 
          that are currently being played by the community or pros. I would also like to add search features to the community and favorites pages so it is easier to find the hero you want quickly.
