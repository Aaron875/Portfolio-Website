    <h2>Goal/Audience</h2>

    <p>The goal of this web page is to show future employers my skills and previous projects in a stylish and organized manner</p>

    <h2>Organization</h2>

    <p>Organizing everything in a center aligned top down manner starting with my bio then gallery and then contact info. A navagation bar at the top (between my picture and name) to take you to the diffrent parts of the site.</p>

    <h2>Future Updates</h2>

    <p>Updates will be carried out as projects get finished. I will need to add in images of my projects( as of right now I only have my GDAPS 2 game to put in) and details about what they are and how I helped during the project.</p>
