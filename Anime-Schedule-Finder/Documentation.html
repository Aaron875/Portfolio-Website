        <h2>Process</h2>

        <p>I started this process with my decision on what api I would like to chose and ended up settling with the Anime Schedule Finder because it's something I would most likely really use.<br>
            I then decided my three controlls would be a search by day controll, a max amount of searches to be shown controll, and a search by genre controll. I decided that both the day and amount of searches controlls<br>
            would be drop down selectors because there would only be a few choices so I thought that would be the best idea. With the amount of genres I needed I figured having a large number of radio buttons would be easier than a drop down menue.<br>
            I then decided how to lay out my data, making it a simple linear scroll to see all the content made the most sense to me seeing as you could limit yourself to a small amount of searches so the user should not have to scroll that far.<br>
            I then decided on my asthetic for the page, which of course as you can see ended up being a vaporwave asthetic given the colors and the background. I recieved some criticism on my prototype for some of the text being hard to read with the background I had chosen<br>
            I changed up the text color and messed with some semi transparent background colors to make the writing more legible because I really wanted to keep my background.  </p>

        <h2>Links</h2>

        <p>My one background image is linked here   <a href='https://www.wallpaperflare.com/outrun-vaporwave-wallpaper-gjedg'>VaporWave Image</a></p>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>

        <p>I selected and used the Anime-Schedule-Finder API. I could not get a local saving working. I have 3 controlls a search by day controll, a max amount of searches to be shown controll, and a search by genre controll.<br>
            What I believe to be a pleasing design and user interaction with receptive errors if any arrises, as well as letting the user know what state the site is in. Coding conventions are all followed.<br>
            All css and javascript are in seperate files from the html as well as having good commenting in the javascript file. Html validates fine, CSS validates with no errors but some minor warnings</p>

        <h2>Personal Grade</h2>

        <p>I believe I should recieve a grade bethween an 85-90 based on the facts that I dont have a local saving and the css does not validate quite 100%, but I believe everything else will recieve full credit</p>
