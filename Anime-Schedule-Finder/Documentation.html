        <h2>Process</h2>

        <p>I started this process with my decision on what api I would like to chose and ended up settling with the Anime Schedule Finder because it's something I would most likely really use.<br>
            I then decided my three controlls would be a search by day controll, a max amount of searches to be shown controll, and a search by genre controll. I decided that both the day and amount of searches controlls<br>
            would be drop down selectors because there would only be a few choices so I thought that would be the best idea. With the amount of genres I needed I figured having a large number of radio buttons would be easier than a drop down menue.<br>
            I then decided how to lay out my data, making it a simple linear scroll to see all the content made the most sense to me seeing as you could limit yourself to a small amount of searches so the user should not have to scroll that far.<br>
            I then decided on my asthetic for the page, which of course as you can see ended up being a vaporwave asthetic given the colors and the background. I recieved some criticism on my prototype for some of the text being hard to read with the background I had chosen<br>
            I changed up the text color and messed with some semi transparent background colors to make the writing more legible because I really wanted to keep my background.  </p>
